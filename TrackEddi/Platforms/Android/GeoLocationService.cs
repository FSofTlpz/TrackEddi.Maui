START_NOT_STICKY        If the system kills the service after onStartCommand() returns, do not recreate the service unless there are pending intents to deliver. 
                        This is the safest option to avoid running your service when not necessary and when your application can simply restart any unfinished jobs.
START_STICKY            If the system kills the service after onStartCommand() returns, recreate the service and call onStartCommand(), but do not redeliver the last intent. 
                        Instead, the system calls onStartCommand() with a null intent unless there are pending intents to start the service. 
                        In that case, those intents are delivered. This is suitable for media players (or similar services) that are not executing commands 
                        but are running indefinitely and waiting for a job.
START_REDELIVER_INTENT  If the system kills the service after onStartCommand() returns, recreate the service and call onStartCommand() with the last intent that 
                        was delivered to the service. Any pending intents are delivered in turn. This is suitable for services that are actively performing a job 
                        that should be immediately resumed, such as downloading a file.
